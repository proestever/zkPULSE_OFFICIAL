```solidity
function deposit(bytes32 _commitment) external payable nonReentrant { ... }
function withdraw(...) external payable nonReentrant { ... }
```

### 1.3 Integer Overflow/Underflow

---

## 2. Zero-Knowledge Proof System

### 2.1 Circuit Security

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**

- Verifier contract matches original deployment
- No modifications to proof verification logic

### 2.3 Proof Generation

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**

- Proper witness calculation with circomlib
- No server-side proof generation (preserves privacy)

---

## 3. Privacy Analysis

### 3.1 Deposit Privacy

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**
- Commitments generated client-side only
- No linkability between deposits and addresses
- Random secrets properly generated with crypto.randomBytes(31)

### 3.2 Withdrawal Privacy

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**
- Zero-knowledge proofs hide deposit linkage
- Nullifiers prevent double-spending without revealing commitment
- Recipient address included in proof prevents front-running

### 3.3 Data Storage

**Finding**: ✅ **PRIVACY PRESERVED**
- No server-side storage of user data
- All deposit notes stored in browser localStorage only
- No tracking or analytics implemented
- Server only generates commitments, stores nothing

---

## 4. Frontend Security

### 4.1 XSS Vulnerabilities

**Finding**: ⚠️ **MINOR RISK** (Mitigated)
- Some innerHTML usage detected but with controlled content
- No user input directly inserted into DOM
- Recommend using textContent where possible

**Affected Files**:
- `app-complete.js`: Message display (controlled content)
- `withdrawal-complete.js`: Success messages (controlled content)
- `enhanced-stats.js`: Statistics display (controlled content)

**Risk Level**: LOW - All innerHTML usage is with application-controlled content, not user input

### 4.2 Private Key Handling

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**
- No private key handling in application
- All signing done through Web3 provider (MetaMask)
- No sensitive data logged or transmitted

### 4.3 HTTPS/TLS

**Recommendation**: Ensure served over HTTPS in production to prevent MITM attacks

---

## 5. Dependencies Audit

### 5.1 Smart Contract Dependencies

**Finding**: ✅ **SECURE**
- OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.4.0 (audited version)
- No other external dependencies

### 5.2 Frontend Dependencies

**Finding**: ⚠️ **MINOR VULNERABILITIES** (Non-critical)
- Some npm packages have known vulnerabilities
- Recommend updating dependencies where possible
- Core cryptographic libraries (snarkjs, circomlib) are at correct versions

**Critical Libraries (Correct Versions)**:
- snarkjs: 0.1.20 (required for compatibility)
- circomlib: 0.0.20 (required for Pedersen hash)
