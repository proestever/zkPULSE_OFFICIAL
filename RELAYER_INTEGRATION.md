## Summary

Successfully added full relayer support to zkPulse! The system is now ready for privacy-enhanced withdrawals through relayers.

## What Was Added

### 1. Smart Contract Compatibility âœ…
- **Good news**: Your existing contracts already support relayers!
- Withdrawal function accepts relayer address and fee parameters
- No contract redeployment needed

### 2. Backend Components

#### `frontend/relayer-config.js`
- Relayer registry and configuration
- Fee calculation logic
- Health check functions
- Relayer submission handlers

#### `relayer/relayer-server.js`
- Standalone relayer server
- Processes withdrawals on behalf of users
- Job queue system for tracking
- Automatic fee management

#### `frontend/unified-server.js` (Updated)
- Added relayer support to proof generation
- New API endpoints for relayer management
- Fee calculation integration

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### `frontend/relayer-ui.js`
- Toggle for enabling relayer use
- Relayer selection dropdown
- Gas speed options
- Real-time fee calculation
- Net amount display

## How to Use

### For Users

1. When withdrawing, toggle "Use Relayer" option
2. Select a relayer from the list
3. Choose gas speed (affects fee)
4. See the net amount you'll receive
5. Submit withdrawal through relayer

### For Relayer Operators

1. Set up the relayer server:
   ```bash
   cd relayer
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your keys
   npm start
   ```

2. Add your relayer to `frontend/relayer-config.js`

3. Ensure your relayer address has sufficient PLS for gas

## API Endpoints

### Main Server (port 8888)
- `GET /api/relayers` - List available relayers
- `GET /api/relayer-fee` - Calculate fee for withdrawal
- `POST /api/withdraw` - Submit withdrawal (with relayer support)

### Relayer Server (port 4000)
- `GET /status` - Health check
- `GET /v1/tornadoFee` - Get fee estimate
- `POST /v1/tornadoWithdraw` - Submit withdrawal
- `GET /v1/jobs/:jobId` - Check job status

## Fee Structure

| Denomination | Fee % | Minimum Fee |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 PLS | 0.75% | 100 PLS |
| 1M PLS | 0.5% | 5,000 PLS |
| 10M PLS | 0.4% | 10,000 PLS |
| 100M PLS | 0.3% | 20,000 PLS |
| 1B PLS | 0.25% | 50,000 PLS |

## Security Features

- âœ… Private key never exposed to frontend
- âœ… Job queue prevents duplicate submissions

- âœ… Gas estimation with buffer
- âœ… Automatic cleanup of old jobs

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy a Relayer**:
   - Set up relayer server on a VPS
   - Configure with real private key
   - Update relayer registry with actual address

2. **Test Integration**:
   - Test withdrawal with relayer
   - Verify fee calculations
   - Check job status tracking

3. **Production Setup**:
   - Use PM2 or Docker for deployment
   - Set up SSL certificates
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add monitoring
